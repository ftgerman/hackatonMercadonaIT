This “Burnt” Basque Cheesecake recipe (known here in Spain as 'tarta de queso') is uniquely light, creamy, delicious, caramelized, and so easy to make that it's perfect for any occasion. 
Ingredients:
2 pounds (1 kg) cream cheese, softened
1 3/4 cups (450g) granulated sugar
4 large eggs, separated
1/2 cup (120ml) heavy cream
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt

Instructions:
Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).
In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese with an electric mixer until smooth.
Add the granulated sugar and beat until combined.
Beat in the egg yolks one at a time, followed by the heavy cream, vanilla extract, and salt.
In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Set aside.
Add the flour to the cream cheese mixture and mix until just combined.
Gently fold in the egg whites until no white streaks remain.
Pour the batter into a 9-inch (23cm) springform pan and smooth the top.
Bake for 25 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 375°F (190°C) and continue baking for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the edges are set and the center is just slightly jiggly.
Remove the cheesecake from the oven and let it cool completely in the pan.
Once the cheesecake has cooled, refrigerate it for at least 4 hours or overnight.
Release the springform pan sides and transfer the cheesecake to a serving plate.
Slice and serve!
Tips and Variations:
To ensure that your cheesecake is smooth and creamy, make sure to beat the cream cheese until it’s completely smooth before adding the other ingredients. 
Also, don’t overmix the batter, as this can cause the cheesecake to become dense.
If you want a more caramelized crust on your cheesecake, bake it for an additional 5-10 minutes. Just keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn’t burn!
You can also customize this recipe by adding different flavorings, such as lemon or orange zest, or a handful of chopped nuts.
